## 文章

### 內容簡介

> Realm is a tale of shattered paradigms and alternate realities that explores the essence of faith, life, and mortality occurring in parallel worlds with different timelines.

> The year is 3039, and the planet Earth is dying. Pollution has corrupted the atmosphere, making life capable only inside bio-domes, where crime runs rampant. Amid this despair and devastation, Rogue, a smuggler and gambler who was orphaned as a child, is struggling to earn enough gold coin to buy his way off Earth for life in an off-world colony.

> Raine is a young, optimistic Global Enforcement Agent trying to save the world one person at a time while working for the most corrupt organization on Earth. When Raine specifically targets Rogue’s smuggling operation for a takedown, she initiates a dance of pursuit and escape that conceals a deeper attachment neither is willing to admit.

> After notorious crime boss Frank Blast tries to kill him, Rogue wakes up in the Realm, a different world that has only been rumored to exist. There, he meets four companions unlike anyone he has ever encountered, whose unique lifestyle of obedience and peace causes him to confront unpleasant truths about his character. Raine, believing Rogue is dead, navigates her way alone on Earth with a plan of vengeance against Frank Blast fueling her actions.

> But life in the Realm is not without its obstacles, and Rogue finds himself forced to choose between helping the Realmers save one of their own or returning to Earth to rescue Raine from death at the hands of Frank Blast.

## 句型

- [【老師救救我】have got to 與 get to 的差別？！ (hopenglish.com)](https://www.hopenglish.com/hope-tips-have-got-to)
  
  - have got to 基本上就是have to ，口語常見
  
  - have
  
  - go to
    
    ```
    have got 與 have
    Have got 其實就是更口語版的 have。
    在正式場合需要用比較正式的 have。
    但如果是平常聊天，用 have got 是很常見的喔。
    
    例如：Do you have any painkillers?（你有沒有止痛藥？）
    →口語上很常見：Have you got any painkillers?
    
    He has a sweet family.（他有一個美滿的家庭。）
    →口語上很常見：He has got a sweet family.
    ```
  
  - gotten 常見如下
    
    ```
    "I've gotten used to going to school". 我習慣去上學了
    
    get used to 習慣
    美國: gotten  used to 
    英國: got     used to
    
    "Have you ever gotten this before?" 餐廳問你曾吃過嗎
    ```
    
    ```
    
    ```
